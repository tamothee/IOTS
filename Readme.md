<h3>Concept</h3>
The user will use a keypad to enter a code to unlock the door. It also uses an LCD to give prompts to the user. Users will also be able to configure their device information through a website.
</br>

<h3>How users are meant to operate and use the product</h3>
<h5>Setting up on the website</h5>
Users will need to set up their device to be connected to the database. To do that, the first thing a user will need to do is to register an account through the website. https://iots.vercel.app/ . After they signed in, they will click create a new device. They fill in the form then press create. Take not of the device id as you will need it later. You can create, read, update and delete your devices through the website.

<h5>Setting up on the door lock</h5>
After the user has created a new device in the website, they will go to the door lock and turn it on. After the door lock boots up, they will be prompted to add in the device id they got earlier on. 
</br>
</br>
<h5>Using the door lock</h5>
After they add in their device id, the door will prompt for the password (which was set in the website). When the user adds in their password, the door will check
 the pasword. If it is authorised, the door will unlock else it will not open.

<h3>Project Demo</h3>

<h3>Security Objective</h3>
<p>
Since our smart door lock system utilises a website, cloud database and the lock itself, our security objective would be to:
<ul>
<li>
prevent threat actors from tampering with the door lock system
</li>
<li>
prevent unauthorized users from unlocking the door system
</li>
<li>
protect user information
</li>
<li>
protect user door system information
</li>
</ul>
These are the core security objective that our system aims to achieve as a security breach of any of these points would result in huge losses for users.

<img src="/img/diagram_flow.jpg" alt="diagram flow" width="70%" height="70%">
</p>

This diagram shows how the different components of the system interact with each other. The ESP32 reads the password and sends it together with the 
pre-configured device id to Mongodb which stores the door system configurations. The Mongodb will run a function to check the device id and password like a 
username and password function. If the device id and password is correct, it will return http code 200 (success) else a http code 401 (unauthorised). The user 
can also use the website to do CRUD operations to their own data (RBAC).

<h3>
Decomposing the IoT System
</h3>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/trust_boundary_diagram.jpg" alt="diagram flow" width="70%" height="70%">
</p>

This diagram demonstrates how we have implemented our trust boundaries and the different features we have put in place to safeguard our data. Our entry points into our system where data is input is at the ESP32 and the website. 
<br/>
The privileged codes that we have identified are:
<ul>
<li>
ESP32 Microcontroller Firmware: The ESP32 microcontroller firmware controls the lock mechanism based on Mongodb reply. This code has access to the lock control functionality and be able to perform critical tasks like reading the keypad input and controlling the lock mechanism.
</li>
<li>
HTTPS Communication between ESP32 and MongoDB: The code responsible for sending and receiving HTTPS requests and responses between the ESP32 and the MongoDB database would also have privileged code. This code would have access to the network stack and be responsible for authenticating and validating the MongoDB server's identity and securing the communication between the ESP32 and the MongoDB server.
</li>
<li>
HTTPS Communication between ESP32 and MongoDB: The code responsible for sending and receiving HTTPS requests and responses between the ESP32 and the MongoDB database would also have privileged code. This code would have access to the network stack and be responsible for authenticating and validating the MongoDB server's identity and securing the communication between the ESP32 and the MongoDB server.
</li>
<li>
MongoDB Database: The code that manages the door lock configuration data in the MongoDB database would also have privileged code. This code would have access to the MongoDB database and be responsible for managing user accounts and door lock configuration data.
</li>
<li>
Auth0: Although theres no code, the system manages the user and password of the Vercel-hosted website and is privileged. This system have access to the user accounts and password data stored in the MongoDB database and be responsible for performing critical tasks like authenticating users, managing passwords, and updating the MongoDB database.
</li>
</ul>


<h4>
OAuth 2.0 framework
</h4>
<p>
The implementation of our website follows the OAuth 2.0 framework. The user will first go through a <b>Authorisation Request</b> to Auth0. If the user is authorised, they will get a <b>Authorisation Grant</b> from Auth0. The user will then use the <b>Authorisation Grant</b> received to retrieve a <b>Access Token</b> from Auth0. The user can then use this <b>Access Token</b> to retrieve data from Mongodb. For a better user experience, Auth0 uses refresh token to silently retrieve a access token when it is expired without user intervention. This allows our user to stay authenticated in our application without needing to logging everytime. The access token expiry set in our application is 86,400 seconds (24 hours) and the refresh token expiry set is 2592000 seconds (30 days).

<h3>Attack Surfaces</h3>
<p>
For each of the attack surfaces, we performed a DREAD analysis as well as a Common Vulneribility Scoring System assessment (CVSS) in order to identify the threat level. Based on this threat level, we came up with proper mitigation techniques that will be implemented into our existing solution.</br>
For the DREAD rating: <br>
Damage: How bad would the damage of the attack be. (1-Low, 3-High) </br>
Reproducibility: How easy is it to reproduce the attack. (1-Difficult, 3-Easy) </br>
Exploitability: How much work is it to launch the attack. (1-Little, 3-A lot) </br>
Affected Users: How many users would be affected by the attack. (1-Little, 3-A lot) </br>
Discoverability: How easy is it to discover the threat. (1-Difficult,Â 3-Easy) </br>
</p>
<h4>Attack Surface 1: Physical Attacks (ESP-32)</h4>
<h5>Vulnerabilities</h5>
<p>
Physically tampering with the door access system and injecting of external code into the microcontroller controlling the door system could potentially result in the whole system failing.
</p>
<h5>Assessment</h5>

|  Category  |  Description  |
|  --------  |  -----------  |
|  Damage (3)  | An attack on the physical hardware would have a very high impact as the physical hardware is the core of the Door Access System.  |
|  Reproducability (1)  | An attack on the hardware level would be very hard to reproduce as it would require the attacker to be physically present at the same location as the hardware  |
|  Exploitability (2)  |   This attack would be considered as medium level exploitability since our product is already placed in a tamper-proof box to secure it.  |
|  Affected Users (1)  |  The home owner would be the main affected user as it would compromise the entire security system, allowing anyone to enter the home of the home owner.  |
|  Discoverability (1)  | Discoverability for physical attacks would be considered as a low level since it would require the threat actor to successfully get into the house in order to inject their code into the microcontroller.  |

<p align="center">

</p>
<p>
CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H
</p>

<h5>Mitigation</h5>
<p>
Risk Response: Treat </br>
In order to treat this attack, physically securing the Door Access System with proper procedures would be recommended. In order to achieve this, we created a tamper proof enclosure for the ESP-32 microcontroller so that it would be very difficult for them to inject their own code and tamper with the microcontroller.

</p>



<h4>Attack Surface 2: ESP-32 Network Attack</h4>
<h5>Vulnerabilities</h5>
<p>
Intercepting of packets being sent from the "Door Access" terminal to the secure endpoint on MongoDB would result in the Personal Identifiable Information (PII/SPI) being leaked to the threat actor as they would be able to know the specific time as to when the home owner leaves and returns.
</p>
<h5>Assessment</h5>
<p>

|  Category  |  Description  |
|  --------  |  -----------  |
|  Damage (1)  | An attack at this level would be be very low in damage as there are proper security procedures implemented into this. For example, packets are sent through using TLS, meaning that it is very hard for hackers to identify and decrypt the Personal Identifiabe Information.  |
|  Reproducability (1)  |  In order to reproduce this type of attack, it would be very easy. However, the exploitaility of this attack is not easy.  |
|  Exploitability (2)  |  This attack has a medium level exploitability as it would require a specific skillset from the threat actor in order to perform this successfully.  |
|  Affected Users (1)  |  Home Owners are the only users that would be affected.  |
|  Discoverability (2)  |  Discovering a vulnerability in order to perform an eavesdropping attack would be considered medium level since it is not very easy to find a vulnerability to intercept the packets.  |

<p align="center">

</p>
<p>
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N 
</p>

<h5>Mitigation</h5>
<p>
Risk Response: Tolerate </br>
In order to mitigate this attack, we chose to encrypt the data at rest as well as the data in transit. The data at rest is encrpted using the PBKDF2 algorithm and the data in transit is encrypted using TLS. This way, even if there was an attacker listening on the packets being transmitted, they would have to find out the encryption algorithm and decrypt the packet before being able to identify the data.
</p>



<h4>Attack Surface 3: Database Attacks (MongoDB)</h4>
<h5>Vulnerabilities</h5>
<p>
Breach of Administrator account credentials. With a breached administrator account, the threat actor would have a full access to the Mongo Database which consists of all the information of end users.
</p>
<h5>Assessment</h5>

|  Category  |  Description  |
|  --------  |  -----------  |
|  Damage (3)  | The damage would be high if the administrator account were to be accessed by a threat actor. This is because the administrator has full access to all the data that resides in the database and is able to configure all the server settings |
|  Reproducability (3)  | The reproducability is would be considered high if the threat actor has found the credentials of the administrator account as they have full access to the database and can make changes as and when they please |
|  Exploitability (3)  | The exploitability would be considered as high since it would be very difficult for a threat actor to gain access to the account. The administrator account for the MongoDB database is securely protected with the use of social logins and 2 factor authentication. The social login also consists of a strong password, reducing the possibility of having a breached administrator account. |
|  Affected Users (3)  | An attack on the database would affect all users, including the Administrator and all end-users  |
|  Discoverability (1)  | The discovery of an IoT threat at this level would be considered as low as it could be very difficult to identify that an account has been breached. This is very similar to the Verkada Breach which occured in 2021  |

<p align="center">

</p>
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
</p>

<h5>Mitigation</h5>
<p>
Risk Response: Transfer </br>
The best mitigation techniques would be implementing social logins that make use of 2 factor authentication, creating a strong password for the social login account, limiting the amount of people that have administrator privileges and having an audit log for important events such as authentications. The main purpose of implementing a strong password would be to minimize the risk of having a compromised password. Having a 2 factor authentication on top of the strong password would act as a gateway to the account, reducing the impact of a compromised user account. Limiting the number of administrator accounts would then help limit the number of potential compromised administrator accounts, reducing the risk of having an administrator account be compromised.

</p>



<h4>Attack Surface 4: Web Server Attacks (Vercel)</h4>
<h5>Vulnerabilities</h5>
<p>
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) of the Vercel webserver to take down the entire website. This attack would have a big impact on <b>availability</b> as the website will become inaccessible to all end-users. 
</p>
<h5>Assessment</h5>

|  Category  |  Description  |
|  --------  |  -----------  |
|  Damage (2)  | An attack of a web server attack would be considered as a middle damage level attack as it would completely prevent users from CRUD functions (Create, Read, Update and Delete functions). This would result in the end-users being unable to change any configuration related to their security system.  |
|  Reproducability (1)  |  In order to reproduce an attack at this level, it would be extremely difficult as Vercal has taken proper precautions to prevent high level threats such as DDoS which could reflect badly on the companys reputation  |
|  Exploitability (1)  |  To perform a DDoS at such a large scale, one that is able to take down a major cloud hosting such as Vercel, the threat actor would be required to be highly skilled and knowledgeable. They would also be require to make use of a extremely large number of zombies  |
|  Affected Users (3)  |  All users would be affected if Vercel were to be taken down as it would prevent them from being able to access and view their cloud based dashboards, which prevents them from using CRUD functions.  |
|  Discoverability (1)  |  It would be very hard to discover how to perform a DDoS attack on such a big cloud hosting service such as Vercel.  |

<p align="center">

</p>
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

<h5>Mitigation</h5>
<p>
Risk Response: Treat & Transfer </br>
Proper mitigation techniques we could for this type of attack would be an automatic identification of any and all suspicious activities from users as well as black listing of the User/IP addresses that may be considered as attempting any malicious activities. However, a Distributed Denial of Service with the use of spoofing of the attacker's IP address would not be within our capabilities to treat. As such, we would be transferring those risks with the use of cloud service providers, which in this case would be Vercel.

</p>


<h4>Attack Surface 5: Web Application Attacks (Auth0)</h4>
<h5>Vulnerabilities</h5>
<p>
One of the most common IoT attacks on web applications that require authentications would be brute force attack. Brute force attack is the act where the threat actor constantly attempts to get into the system by guessing the user credentials on the website application.
</p>
<h5>Assessment</h5>

|  Category  |  Description  |
|  --------  |  -----------  |
|  Damage (3)  | The damage would be considered high for this attack as the threat actor would be able to reconfigure the settings of the home owner, potentially allowing the threat actor to get into the home of the account owner.  |
|  Reproducability (1)  |  The reproducability of this attack would be considered as low since there are proper precautions in place to prevent such attacks. Some examples would be a restriction and notification alert sent to the account owner if there was a number of failed attempts. |
|  Exploitability (1)  |  A brute force attack would be considered as low exploitability since it required a large amount of effort and time to enter each potential password.  |
|  Affected Users (1)  |  The only affected user would be the end-user whose account was breached by this attack.  |
|  Discoverability (3)  |  It does not difficult for a threat actor perform a brute force attack as it requires little to no knowledge about IoT attacks.  |
<p align="center">
<img src="/img/OWaspVulnerabilityScore5.png" alt="Calculated Vulnerability Score 5" width="75%" height="75%">
</p>
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L
</p>
<h5>Mitigation</h5>
<p>
Risk Response: Treat </br>
Recommended mitigation techniques for this attack would include an alert and locking of the account after a set number of failed attempts. This has been implemented as part of Auth0's compliance. An additional method in preventing this attack would be the implementation of 2FA. With the use of 2FA, if the threat actor were to successfully authenticate themselves with the use of the username and password, they would still require authentication from the 2nd factor, which is highly unlikely.

<h3>Security Testing of IoT Product</h3>
<p>For the Security Testing portion, we have come up with two separate methods that would successfully penetrate the developed IoT Product.</p>

<h4>Method 1: Distributed Denial of Service Attack</h4>
<p>
For method 1, we would be performing a Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS). This attack has a sole purpose of denying the end user from being able to access the IoT Device, completely stopping the Smart Door System from working. For this DDoS attack, we would be flooding the network address with an absurd amount of traffic to the point where the IoT Devices would not be able to receive any incoming commands from the IoT Gateway.
</p>
<h5>Step 1: Access the network of the target IoT Device </h5>
<p>
Access Kali and kill all processes using the WiFi interface

`airmon-ng check kill`

Start the network adapter in monitor mode and view all nearby access points to identify target network.
<p align="center">
<img src="/img/AllNearbyAP.jpg" alt="All Nearby AP" width="75%" height="75%">
</br><i>All Nearby AccessPoints (GeeksforGeeks, 2022)</i>
</p>
View all the clients that are connected to the network

`airodump-ng -c 1 --bssid 80:35:C1:13:C1:2C -w /root wlan0mon`

Deauthenticate all clients from the network in order to get them to re-authenticated themselves. While clients attempt to re-authenticate themselves, we would be able to capture the WPA handshake.

`aireplay-ng -0 10 -a 80:35:C1:13:C1:2C wlan0mon`

After obtaining the handshake, compare the handshake with a dictionary consisting of all common passwords.

`aircrack-ng -a2 -b 80:35:C1:13:C1:2C -w /root/passwords.txt /root/hacking-01.cap`

<p align="center">
<img src="/img/ObtainedKey.jpg" alt="Obtained Key" width="75%" height="75%">
</p>
</p>

<h5>Step 2: Identify the target IoT Device </h5>
<p>
After gaining access to the same network as the IoT device, we would be able to scan the network using third-party softwares such as "Advanced IP Scanner" to identify the device we are trying to attack. In this case, it would be the device under the manufacturer "Espressif Systems".
<p align="center">
<img src="/img/AdvancedIPScanner.png" alt="Advanced IP Scanner" width="75%" height="75%">
</p>

</p>
<h5>Step 3: Perform the Attack </h5>
<p>
After we successfully identified the IP address of the target IoT device, we would be able to perform the Distributed Denial of Service attack by flooding the network with hping or with the use of zombies. 

`sudo hping3 "192.168.9.243" -q -n -d -S -p 443 --flood --rand-source`

An alternative way to make use of the device would be to convert the Smart Door System into a Zombie for DDoS attacks on the internal network. Since we have attained access to the IoT Device, we could turn it into an IoT threat for the rest of their network, completely breaking down the home network of the end user.</br>
For a guide on how to set up zombies, see here https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/slowloris-ddos-attack-tool-in-kali-linux/.

<h4>Method 2: Man in the Middle Attack</h4>
<p>
For method 2, we are going with the assumption that the IoT Device has been mass produced and deployed. This would result in the product connecting to the Access Points to gain access to the internet. As such, another threat that the IoT product faces would be Man in the Middle Attacks (MITM). For MITM attacks, there would be a fake access point that would be identical to that of the real one, causing the end user to misinterpret the fake access point as the real one and connecting to it, sending their personal data directly to the threat actor.

<p>
Follow the guide provided for Method 1 Step 1.
</p>

<h5>Step 2: Create a fake access point using WiHotspot </h5>
<p>
After identifying the network access point details, create a fake access point using any of the preferred tools such as wifiphisher. In this case, we will be using wihotspot, which is a GUI based tool. </br>
In the GUI of wihotspot, set the SSID and password of fake access point to be that of the real one and click on create. This will create the fake access point which will act as a bait for the end user to connect to.

</p>
After setting up the fake access point, it would show up alike any other hotspots or available access points. To speed up the process, we would de-authenticate all the users that are currently connected to the real access point. This would increase the chances of the end user connecting their IoT device to our fake access point that we have created.

</p>

<h5>Step 3: Analyze incoming transmissions </h5>
<p>
After the users have connected to the fake access points, all the data that is intended to be sent to the cloud database will be sent to the threat actor instead. The last step would be to decrypt the received packets and we would have successfully obtained the private data of the end user.

<h3>Documentation (to run this system yourself)</h3>
<h4>Website</h4>
The website is hosted on vercel and is reachable via https://iots.vercel.app/ . The website is built on NextJS which is a meta ReactJS framework which allows developers to create full stack web application. It also uses MongoDB as a database to store the user device information and Auth0 to handle user authentication and storing of user information.

       You should see the website running
      </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
    Now you need to create a new Auth0 account https://auth0.com/
    </li>
    <li>
    Login to auth0 
    </li>
    <li>
    Go to applications and create a new application

    Add in  https://YOUR-VERCEL-APP-URL/api/auth/callback/auth0, http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback . You do not need to add in the first one if you did not push       the code to vercel
    </li>
    <li>
    Scroll down and save your changes
    </li>
    <li>
    Now you need to create your MongoDB database
    </li>
    <li>

    Under <b>JWK URI</b> go back to auth0 application settings and scroll all the way down to advanced settings
    </li>
    <li>
    Go to the <b>Endpoints</b> tab and copy the JSON Web Key Set. It should look something like https://YOUR-TENANT/.well-known/jwks.json
    </li>
    <li>
    Go back to the MongoDB and paste what you copied to the JWK URI
    </li>
    <li>
    Go to trigger and add a new trigger
    </li>
    <li>
    Set the trigger type to Authentication
    </li>
    <li>

```javascript
exports = function(authEvent) {
  const user = authEvent.user;
  const mongodb = context.services.get("IOTS-database");
  const usersCollection = mongodb.db("IOTS_dashboard").collection("users");
  usersCollection.insertOne({
    ...user
  });
};
```
</li>
    <li>
    Save it and go back to the <b>Authentication</b> tab
    </li>
    <li>
    Click on edit for the API Keys and create a new API Key and name it Door_Auth. Save the API key somewhere safe as you will not see it again. This will be your API key that you will use for the esp32 query
    </li>
    <li>
    While you are saving the api key, on the sidebar, at the top, there is a copy icon. Click on it as save it as that is your app id and you will need it later
    </li>
    go back to the auth0
    <li>
    Go over to APIs and create a new API
    </li>
    <li>
    Name it whatever you want and the identifier is the mongodb app id which you saved and the click create
    </li>
    <li>
    Now if you are running the code on localhost, create a <b>.env</b> file at the <b>root directory</b>. If you are using vercel go over to <b>settings</b> and <b>Environment Variables</b>. Then add this into your env either on vercel or your .env file in your root directory
    
```

AUTH0_AUDIENCE= <your mongodb app id that you saved>
NEXTAUTH_SECRET= <random secret of any length that you can use openssl to generate for you. would recommend 32 characters long>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SALT = <the salt that you will use to hash the users device password. would also recommend to use openssl and 32 characters long to generate the salt>
```
</li>
  <li>
    Go back to mongodb app services
  </li>
  <li>
    Go to HTTPS Endpoints and create a new HTTPS Endpoint 
  </li>
  <li>
    Set the route to be /doorauth

   <li>
    Under <b>Operation Type</b> copy the url
  </li>
  <li>
    Set the <b>HTTP Method</b> to post
  </li>
  <li>
    Set the <b>Return Type</b> to JSON
  </li>
   <li>
    Under <b>Function</b> add a new function and copy this code
    
    
```javascript
exports = async function({ query, headers, body}, response) {
  const CryptoJS = require("crypto-js");

    const serialized = body.text();
    const data = JSON.parse(serialized);
    
    const {deviceId, userPassword} = data;
    console.log(deviceId);
    console.log(userPassword)
    const dbPassword = await context.services.get("IOTS-database").db("IOTS_dashboard").collection("iot").findOne(
    {device_id: deviceId},
    {password: 1}
    )
    console.log(dbPassword);
    
    console.log("dbpassword", dbPassword)
    
    if (dbPassword){
      console.log("not null")
       if (dbPassword.password === CryptoJS.PBKDF2(userPassword, "<Your salt that you generated just now>",  {
              keySize: 256 / 32,
              iterations: 1000,
            }).toString()){
              console.log("authorised")
         return "authorised"
       }
        return "Username or Password is invalid"
    }else{
      console.log('invalid')
      return "Username or Password is invalid";
    }

};

```
</li>
  <li>
  Go to your esp32 code and add the API key of the doorauth you saved just now as well as add your http endpoint url to the endpoint variable
  </li>
</ol>
